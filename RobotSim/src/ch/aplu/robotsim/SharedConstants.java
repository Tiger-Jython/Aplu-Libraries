                     - NxtRobot: critical methods synchronized
 * V1.06 - Oct 2010  - Move window to upper left screen corner
                     - NxtRobot.exit() stops all movement now
 * V1.07 - Nov 2010  - Added LightSensor.addLightListener() with default level
                     - Added LightSensor.setTriggerLevel()
                     - Added SoundSensor.addLightListener() with default level

 * V1.08 - Oct 2011  - Modified: Nxt.getPartLocation() is public now
 * V1.09 - Oct 2011  - Modified: turn angular speed when two motors have same speed is
 *                     speed dependent now
 *                   - Added NxtRobot.reset() to set robot at start position/direction
 * V1.10 - Oct 2011  - Modified: Turn rotation step is 1 degree now (instead of 6)
 * V1.11 - Feb 2012  - Fixed: LightSensor bright(), dark() now return port correctly
 * V1.12 - Mar 2012  - Added: Button.isDown() for compatiblity with leJOS 0.91
 *                   - Fixed: Blocking methods wait with Thread.sleep(1) now
 *                   - Modified: polling methods calls Thread.sleep(1) now
 * V1.13 - Jul 2012  - Fixed: Part instances may now be created as instance variables
 *                     (ArrayOutOfBounds error fixed)
 * V1.14 - Jan 2013  - Modified: gearTurnAngle depends on speed now
 *                   - Modified: TurtleRobot.left(), right() now turn with small speed
 *                   - Fixed: _init() now also works with TurtleRobot

 * V1.19 - Oct 2013  - Added: Throw RuntimeException when error in DisposeOnClose 
 * V1.20 - Nov 2013  - Modified in class gear: all timed moving commands can
 *                     now be interrupted by calling other moving commands
 * V1.21 - Nov 2013  - Added: NxtContext.useTarget() with array parameters
 * V1.22 - Jan 2014  - Fixed: added lost NxtContext.showNavigationBar()
 * V1.23 - May 2014  - NxtRobot renamed to LegoRobot, NxtContext renamed to RobotContext
 *                     Dummy classes NxtRobot, NxtContext for compatibility with
 *                     pre-EV3 programs
 * V1.24 - Jul 2014  - Added: class PackageInfo
 *                   - Refactored package ch.aplu.nxtsim to ch.aplu.robotsim
 *                   - Added: Tools.startTimer(), getTime()
 * V1.25 - Jul 2014  - Added: color cubes in ColorSensor, class ColorLabel
